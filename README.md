# hello-world
The standard github exercise

Make and commit changes

Click the README.md file.
Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
In the editor, write a bit about yourself.

    I'm experienced at version control, but not git.  Git looks good compared to the proprietary software I've used in the past.  I'm an engineer who likes both hardware and software.  It's interesting how indent indents the second line, too.  I like that.

Write a commit message that describes your changes.

Click Commit changes button.
